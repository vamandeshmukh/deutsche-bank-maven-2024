//Behavioral Patterns
//Focus on communication between objects and the responsibilities of objects.
//Deal with the interaction and responsibilities of objects.
//
//Template Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the base class but 
//lets subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.
//Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
//Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
