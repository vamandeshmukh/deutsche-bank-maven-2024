//Structural Patterns
//Deal with object composition and the relationship between objects.
//Focus on how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.
//
//Bridge Pattern: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
//Decorator Pattern: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
//Proxy Pattern:  Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
